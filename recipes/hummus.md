# Hummus (metric)

* 520g hydrated garbanzo beans (this is about 200g dried)
* 2.5 tbsp tahini (light/dark - doesn't matter)
* 2.5 lemons
* 2 tsp salt
* ~1c water (you'll add this as needed)
* 1 clove garlic

1. soak the beans overnight, then simmer them in a pot for 45min-1h, until soft/easy to pierce with fork. Drain and set aside.
2. Squeeze the lemons and pick out seeds
3. In a food processor, mix at medium speed 2/3 of the lemon juice and tahini until smooth
4. Add garlic to food processor and continue to mix
5. Slowly add garbanzo beans, alternating with water as needed to maintain a smooth creamy paste.
6. Mix all of this until smooth - that usually takes 10 minutes or so
7. taste and see if it needs more lemon or tahini. Add these to taste
8. eat all your damn hummus you're a star
